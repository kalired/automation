# In the script above:

# The credentials for a local computer user are defined with the $localUsername and $localPassword variables.
# The ConvertTo-SecureString cmdlet is used to convert the plain text password into a secure string.
# The New-Object cmdlet is used to create a PSCredential object with the local username and the secure password.
# The Export-Clixml cmdlet is used to export the local credentials as an encrypted XML file at the specified path ("C:\temp\local_credentials.xml" in the example).
# Similarly, the credentials for a domain administrator are defined with the $domainUsername and $domainPassword variables, encrypted, and saved as an XML file ("C:\temp\domain_credentials.xml" in the example).
# Make sure to replace the placeholder passwords with your desired passwords for the local user and domain administrator.

# Remember to securely manage and protect the encrypted credentials files, as they contain sensitive information.
